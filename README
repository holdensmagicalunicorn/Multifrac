README for Multifrac
====================

Multifrac is a multithreaded fractal renderer (Mandelbrot set and Julia
sets) written in Java. It's intended to generate detailed high
resolution images in a reasonable time. It's *NOT* a realtime fractal
explorer.


Some more features:

 - Smooth coloring without color banding (well, still 24bit RGB).
 - A zoomable colorizer panel let's you easily set up your gradients.
 - Mouse navigation as well as direct parameter input.
 - Adaptive iteration depth depending on your current zoom level.
 - 2x2, 4x4 supersampling.
 - Loading/Saving "scenes" and the gradients of other scenes.
 - Undo/Redo stack.
 - ...


Build / Usage
=============

Apache ant should be used to create the .jar file, a build.xml is included.
This means that you can simply build the project via:

 $ cd /path/to/git/repo
 $ ant

In order to render high resolution images, you should increase memory size used
by java. Given your system has ~2GB of RAM, you could run the application via:

 $ java -Xmx1800m -jar dist/Multifrac.jar

If you get an "out of memory" error during the *save* process, you can try to
use my TIFF writer instead of the builtin java libraries. You do so by simply
saving the file as "*.tif" or "*.tiff".

The application tries to warn you, in advance, if the image you want to render
doesn't fit in your memory. However, in some cases, it may still fail. With 2GB
of RAM, you should be able render images of the following sizes:

 - 20'400 x 20'400 pixels without supersampling
 - 4300 x 4300 pixels with 4x4 supersampling

A "render directly to file" functionality is not yet included (but may be added
in the future).
